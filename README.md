Biome Check Plugin for TShock Terraria Servers


To Use
======

Download the plugin file here:  https://github.com/Icehawk78/BiomeCheck/raw/master/BiomeCheck/bin/Debug/BiomeCheck.dll

Add that to your ServerPlugins/ folder in your TShock installation directory.

In game, then simply type '/biomecheck' to get a report of all biomes that the game currently considers your character to be in.

This is primarily useful for things like Key and Soul farms, but currently only covers the more basic biomes (Corruption, Crimson, Hallowed, Ice, Jungle, Dungeon, Meteor). More may follow, later.
